Title: Create Screencast To Demo Basic Features Of Android Mobile Banking App
Description: During the most recent Google Summer of Code, interns have implemented a brand new Android mobile banking app. It includes some powerful new consumer-facing features that would be great to highlight in a brief demo. Your demo should highlight the new features: 
* Login along with Passcode functionality 
* Create a loan, then update that loan and then withdraw it.
* Filter Loan accounts (using top right icon in the toolbar)
* Show details of a savings account 
* Perform a Third party Transfer
* Adding a Beneficiary (and showing the list of beneficiaries after adding it)

Demo video should be no more than 2 minutes long. You can hook up your phone via a data cable to your PC and then based on your environment, we'll recommend a program to record the screencast. Source code and technical documentation can be found at  https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app
