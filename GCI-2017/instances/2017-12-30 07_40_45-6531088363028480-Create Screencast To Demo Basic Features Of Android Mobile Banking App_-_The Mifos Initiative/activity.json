Although the screenshot you attached does mention \"free for non-profit\", the second paragraph also refrains from using the file to promote any product. Since I'm not sure if our case obliges to the condition, I'll leave it for Ed to consider it.\n\nI'll suggest you sending a link to the video with the music too (if you still have that). The concerned people may have a look at it when they'll have time. \n\nBy the way, the latest video ends the demo abruptly and does not show the \"beneficiary added\" screen.

It looks quite bland without any narration.

Although you missed saving account's details, it's still good and you don't need to record again. :) \n\nThank you very much for confirming the devices on which the app crashed and I apologize for the inconvenience caused.

It'll be great if you could tell which APIs you've tried it on and found it crashing. \n\nTo answer your question, I'm afraid I can't approve the task unless it satisfies all the requirements. Nevertheless, I've checked that the app works fine on Lollipop devices. If you happen to have some device with Lollipop, you can use that or create Android Virtual Device (also called emulator) to complete the task.",
