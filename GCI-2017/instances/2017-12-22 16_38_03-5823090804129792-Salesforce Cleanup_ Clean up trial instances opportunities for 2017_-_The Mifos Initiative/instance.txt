Title: Salesforce Cleanup: Clean up trial instances opportunities for 2017
Description: We use Salesforce for managing our database of customers, partners, and volunteers and all communications and contact history with them.

This task involves cleaning up the Trial Instance Opportunities within Salesforce so they're properly cataloged for reporting purposes.  

For each of these trial instance opportunities: 

* Opportunity Record Type (this can be edited under System Information by clicking "Change" : If the Lead Source is Mifos.org - Trial User Form, Value should be Mifos X Trial for Opportunity Record Type 

Once record type is correct,  we must ensure it has the following fields:

* Title following this format: [Account Name - Trial Instance] 
* Country Dropdown (look in the mailing country field or the country value for the parent account)
* Region Dropdown (deduce this based on the country field - refer to other records for reference)
