You should create a list of ten FAQs related to Blockchain for Financial Inclusion in a Google Doc which we will later publish on our wiki. Please make sure you cite websites from where you find information and link back to them. Link to relevant videos, PDFs, white papers, etc. You can come up with the list of the ten questions based on your research.\n\nPlease share a Google Doc with your FAQ and links to source materials as your deliverable."
