Title: Find and Catalog 25 LinkedIn Groups related to Credit Unions & Banks
Description: One of our objectives as a non-profit initiative, is to serve as a thought leader for open source, fintech, and technology-enabled financial inclusion. LinkedIn and its expansive network of experts and professionals provides a good forum for us to position ourselves as a thought leader. There exist various LinkedIn Groups in the domains we operate in where we could network, promote our accomplishments, and participate in valuable discussions. 

This task centers around researching and cataloging LinkedIn Groups that we could join. For this task, you need to research and put in our Google Sheet Database, 25 LinkedIn Groups for the specific domain. Don't duplicate groups others have listed. 

Credit Unions & Banks: Search terms can include SACCOs, credit unions, core banking, financial cooperatives, etc.

For each group you find, you must input the following in the Google Sheet at https://goo.gl/kSoTWW

* Group Name
* Category of Group
* Description of Group (what is listed under about this Group)
* URL for Group
* Number of Members in Group

To search for groups by name or keyword:
Go to Linkedin.com (while logged in) and in the search box at the top of your LinkedIn homepage, type keywords or group names of interest, and click Search.
On the search results page, click the Groups tab.
