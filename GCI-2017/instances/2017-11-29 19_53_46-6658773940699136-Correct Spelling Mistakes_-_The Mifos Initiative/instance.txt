Title: Correct Spelling Mistakes
Description: We have three strings with a typo whose values are :-
- Their is no SavingsAccount associated with you.
- Their is no LoanAccount associated with you.
- Their is no ShareAccount associated with you.

It should be 'There' instead of their, which can be fixed by correct the spelling in strings.xml
You have to correct the spellings from this line: https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/blob/development/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L123 to this line https://github.com/openMF/mifos-mobile/blob/development/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml#L127
