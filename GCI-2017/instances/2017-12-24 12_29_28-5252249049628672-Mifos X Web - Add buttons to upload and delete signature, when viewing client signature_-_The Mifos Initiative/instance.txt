Title: Mifos X Web - Add buttons to upload and delete signature, when viewing client signature
Description: In the community-app, go to Clients and click on any client. In order to upload a client signature, the user has to click on the More>>Upload Signature, same goes for deleting a signature. It would be much convenient if we had the upload and delete buttons when viewing the signature.
