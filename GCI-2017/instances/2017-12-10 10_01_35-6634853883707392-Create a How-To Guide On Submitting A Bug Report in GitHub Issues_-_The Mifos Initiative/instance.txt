Title: Create a How-To Guide On Submitting A Bug Report in GitHub Issues
Description: We recently started using GitHub issues for reporting bugs and new feature requests for our web and mobile apps that are powered by Apache Fineract. We need to create a simple guide on how to use the issue tracker and how to report a good issue as a GitHub wiki page. You can follow the previous guide at: Bug Entry Guidelines ( https://mifosforge.jira.com/wiki/spaces/MIFOS/pages/4850267/Bug+Entry+Guidelines ). Please explain what each field is, take screenshots of the steps. Bonus - create an issue template in GitHub
