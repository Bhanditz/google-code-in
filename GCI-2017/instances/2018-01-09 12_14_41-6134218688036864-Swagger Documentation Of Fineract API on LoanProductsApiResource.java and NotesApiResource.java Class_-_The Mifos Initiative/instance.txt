Title: Swagger Documentation Of Fineract API on LoanProductsApiResource.java and NotesApiResource.java Class
Description: **Overview & Objectives:** Annotate the [LoanProductsApiResource.java](https://github.com/Sanyam96/incubator-fineract/blob/GCI-swagger-integration/fineract-provider/src/main/java/org/apache/fineract/portfolio/loanproduct/api/LoanProductsApiResource.java) and [NotesApiResource.java](https://github.com/Sanyam96/incubator-fineract/blob/GCI-swagger-integration/fineract-provider/src/main/java/org/apache/fineract/portfolio/note/api/NotesApiResource.java) with Swagger Annotations and in the field description and for the specific values for the annotation can easily be found in the current documentation.

**Description:** Don't lose any documentation that's already on the current REST API docs, maintain it's human readable comments (by moving that into JavaDoc/annotations in code which SpringFox/Swagger exploit), the "sections", etc

**Helpful Skills:** Swagger, Java, REST, Git.

**Please Note: ** **-> All the Swagger Documentation Pull Request should be created on Branch "GCI-swagger-integration" https://github.com/Sanyam96/incubator-fineract/tree/GCI-swagger-integration **


**Some Information about Swagger Documentation is given below ;)**

- Swagger is used for the dynamic documentation of REST API for Apache Fineract which can easily replace [apiLive.htm](https://demo.openmf.org/api-docs/apiLive.htm "the current documentation") (the current documentation)

- In most of our cases, we are using @Api, @ApiOperation, @ApiImplicitParams, @ApiResponses and other Swagger Annotations for dynamic documentation of Fineract APIâ€™s

  For Information about Swagger Annotations refer  [Swagger-Core](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X/ "Annotations") Annotations.

- Refer the [Pull Request #409](https://github.com/apache/fineract/pull/409/ "Swagger Documentation on FINERACT") on branch "swagger-documentation-integration" to get details about the integration of Swagger on Fineract and how Annotation are used in the Pull Request.
