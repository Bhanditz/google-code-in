Tell us how you learned about GCI, how many tasks you worked on, your appreciation of Google's GCI program and the Mifos Initiative as a whole:


Personally, I learned about the Google Code In program from my friends who also enjoy programming very much. Our desire to learn more about coding and technologies fueled our voraciousness in wanting to participate.

I worked on 3 tasks as the session for GCI is now coming to an end. If only I would have heard of this amazing competition sooner, I could have completed an abundance of tasks!

I think that Google's GCI program is a marvelous idea geared towards getting young teenagers to become more involved with programming. And the best part about the program is that you do not need to be an expert in code, as long as you understand the concepts, you can complete many of the proposed tasks. Not only do the tasks teach how to do useful things related to technology, they also end up teaching the user how to use the specific websites. As I worked through all of the tasks, I found myself building a firm appreciation for all of the various fields in technology.

In regards to the non-profit Mifos Initiative, I think that it is great that such large organizations are doing whatever they can to stop poverty. It really reminds me that there are good people in the world who want to put an end to others suffering. I think it's marvelous to integrate technology into ending poverty through an open source banking platform to bring financial services to the people that need it the most. I would truly love to do all I can to help in such a distinguished effort. And to be able to work on these tasks on the mobile device made it very convenient. A team of very intellectual and kind minds can, after all, achieve anything that may originally seem impossible.
