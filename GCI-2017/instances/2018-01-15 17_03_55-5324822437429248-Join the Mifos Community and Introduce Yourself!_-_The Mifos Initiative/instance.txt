Title: Join the Mifos Community and Introduce Yourself!
Description: We have a number of collaborative tools to engage with the community. 

Mailing lists are the primary communication channels in most open source projects so it’s essential you get comfortable with conversing openly via them. 

This task involves signing up for various community accounts for Mifos & Apache Fineract and then sending an email to the lists (mifos-developer@lists.sourceforge.net and dev@fineract.apache.org) introducing yourself including the following: name, current year in school, where you’re located, what you’re studying & what you hope to gain by participating in GCI with the Mifos Initiative.

As your deliverable, please include a screenshot of the sent email and a list of your usernames for the various accounts you signed up for.
