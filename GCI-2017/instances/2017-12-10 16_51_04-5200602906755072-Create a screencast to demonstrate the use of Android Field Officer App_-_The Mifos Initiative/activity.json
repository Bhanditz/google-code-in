And also can you replace \"three dots\" with \"Pop Up menu (three  dots)\" in the .srt file.    \n\nI have illustrated a few examples below (the numbers correspond to the serial numbers present in the mifos.srt file) - \n\n3 -> To Logout, tap on the Pop-up Menu (three dots) located at the top right corner and then tap on Logout  \n4-> Tap on the Spinner (drop down menu)\n5-> Then tap on clients\n7-> Tap on any client to view their account details\n9-> Tap on the Spinner (drop down menu) again\n10-> Tap on Groups\n11-> Then tap on a Group \n13-> To create a client, tap on the Pop Up menu (three dots) and select \"Create Client\"\n\n->",
