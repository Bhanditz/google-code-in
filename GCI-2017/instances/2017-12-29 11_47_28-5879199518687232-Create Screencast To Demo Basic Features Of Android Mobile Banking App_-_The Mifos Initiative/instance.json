    "description": "During the most recent Google Summer of Code, interns have implemented a brand new Android mobile banking app. It includes some powerful new consumer-facing features that would be great to highlight in a brief demo. Your demo should highlight the new features: \n* Login along with Passcode functionality \n* Create a loan, then update that loan and then withdraw it.\n* Filter Loan accounts (using top right icon in the toolbar)\n* Show details of a savings account \n* Perform a Third party Transfer\n* Adding a Beneficiary (and showing the list of beneficiaries after adding it)\n\nDemo video should be no more than 2 minutes long. You can hook up your phone via a data cable to your PC and then based on your environment, we'll recommend a program to record the screencast. Source code and technical documentation can be found at  https://github.com/openMF/self-service-app \n\n**Gifs and screenshots of major features can be found at: https://goo.gl/NZFMon**"
