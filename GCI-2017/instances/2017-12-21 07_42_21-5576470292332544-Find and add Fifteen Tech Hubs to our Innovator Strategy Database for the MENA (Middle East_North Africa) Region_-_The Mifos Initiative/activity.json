The flu took me out for the past week, but I'm feeling better than ever (thankfully for Christmas).\n\nMy research on MENA is on rows 214 to 228 (15 total inclusive). It was pretty cool to learn about how entrepreneurship can thrive in other areas of the world, as well as a new concept that I never knew about: startup accelerators and incubators and how they help take a new company off the ground.\n\nBest,\nYibin",
