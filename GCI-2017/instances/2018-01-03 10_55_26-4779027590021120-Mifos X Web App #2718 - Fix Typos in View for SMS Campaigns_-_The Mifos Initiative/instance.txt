Title: Mifos X Web App #2718 - Fix Typos in View for SMS Campaigns
Description: Description
There are several very glaring typos in the SMS Campaigns module.

Steps to Reproduce
Navigate to Organization >> SMS Campaigns. The title reads "SMScampaings" rather than SMS Campaigns.
View Campaigns has a typo as well. From SMS Campaigns click any campaign to view it. Title says "View SMS Campain" instead of View SMS Campaign
Edit Campaigns has a typo too. From a Schedules SMS Campaign that is still pending, click edit. The next title should read Edit SMS Campaign but it says "Edit SMS Campain"
This all occurred on https://mobile.openmf.org with credentials mifos/password
