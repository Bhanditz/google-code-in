    "description": "Description\nThere are several very glaring typos in the SMS Campaigns module.\n\nSteps to Reproduce\nNavigate to Organization >> SMS Campaigns. The title reads \"SMScampaings\" rather than SMS Campaigns.\nView Campaigns has a typo as well. From SMS Campaigns click any campaign to view it. Title says \"View SMS Campain\" instead of View SMS Campaign\nEdit Campaigns has a typo too. From a Schedules SMS Campaign that is still pending, click edit. The next title should read Edit SMS Campaign but it says \"Edit SMS Campain\"\nThis all occurred on https://mobile.openmf.org with credentials mifos/password\n\nSee attached screenshots."
