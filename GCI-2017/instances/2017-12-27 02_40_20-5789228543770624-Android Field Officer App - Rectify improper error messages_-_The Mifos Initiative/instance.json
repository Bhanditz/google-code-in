    "description": "The **Android Field Officer App** displays error messages in Toasts or in SnackBars.\n\nIn certain cases the error messages being displayed are unable to properly convey the message that they intend to convey either due to **grammatical errors** or due to the **incomprehensible error messages** being displayed to the end-user (such as error messages displayed from server responses)\n\nThe app currently has a few such error messages; your task will be to find such error messages and then either reconstitute them or create new simple, easy to comprehend error messages for the end-user. \n\n[Here](https://i.imgur.com/g79yON3.png), you can see that instead of displaying a user-friendly error message, it displays the error message received from the HTTP response which isn't really user friendly. Apart from this, there are also error messages which have a lot of grammatical errors in them; and they need to be rectified."
