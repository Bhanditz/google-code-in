Title: Android Field Officer App - Rectify improper error messages
Description: The **Android Field Officer App** displays error messages in Toasts or in SnackBars.

In certain cases the error messages being displayed are unable to properly convey the message that they intend to convey either due to **grammatical errors** or due to the **incomprehensible error messages** being displayed to the end-user (such as error messages displayed from server responses)

The app currently has a few such error messages; your task will be to find such error messages and then either reconstitute them or create new simple, easy to comprehend error messages for the end-user. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/g79yON3.png), you can see that instead of displaying a user-friendly error message, it displays the error message received from the HTTP response which isn't really user friendly. Apart from this, there are also error messages which have a lot of grammatical errors in them; and they need to be rectified.
