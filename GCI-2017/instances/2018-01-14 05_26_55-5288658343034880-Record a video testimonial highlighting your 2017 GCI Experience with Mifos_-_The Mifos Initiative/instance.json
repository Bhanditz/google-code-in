    "description": "To help tell our community how impactful Google Code-In is for you and for the community, we'd like to share video testimonials documenting your experiences. These will also be valuable to help other prospective GCI students next year see why they should participate with Mifos.\n\nThese video testimonials will be posted to our website, social media, and our YouTube channel.\n\nTo make it concise, here are some tips on what you should say and focus on in your testimonial\n\n- Your Name, Year in School and City/State or Country you participated in (don't need to say high school so you're not sharing too much private information) and you can also state that you participated in Code-In in 2017 \n- What you worked on and what you learned\n- What you found most valuable/rewarding working with Mifos Initiative\n- What advice would you share with other GCI participants? \n- Why other students should participate in GCI (with Mifos Initiative)\n\nTips for Filming testimonial\n- Do it in a well-lit area\n- Don't have distracting objects or action happening in background. \n- Have a good microphone or source of sound \n- Use a high-resolution camera that's stable (webcam or laptop camera should normally be fine)\n- Be enthusiastic!\n\nYou can upload this to Google Drive and then share with me."
