Title: Mifos X Web App - Show a 404 Not Found page when a user routes to unintended routes
Description: ## Description

Currently, when a user routes to something other than intended routes, it shows a blank view with no message (see screenshot in external link).

## Fix

We should add an `otherwise` method in routes.js where if a route does not match the list of routes in routes.js, we show a 404 page to the user. Design of the page can be simple.
