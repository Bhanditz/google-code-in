Description: 1.If we closed any Center, Group & Client even any loan it Should not come on user Interface 
2.Presently it comes on User Interface.
3.I proposed a "Show All" button on UI it works when a user need to view details including closed items.
4. In reports the balance shown is 0 always when the account has been closed I think it should not comes in reports.After a certain level of organisation it creates panic.
