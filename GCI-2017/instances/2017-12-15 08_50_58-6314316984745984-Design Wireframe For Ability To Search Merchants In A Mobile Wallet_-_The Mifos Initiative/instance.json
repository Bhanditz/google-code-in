    "description": "Now that we have self-service APIs in place, a number of community members are building out self-service application and mobile wallets. We would like to provide reference designs and mockups as guidelines for mobile wallets. This task involves creating a wireframe mockup in Balsamiq (using an account provided by Mifos) for the mobile wallet interface for searching for merchants to make a mobile or electronic payment to. A user should be able to go into the application and either search for merchants by name, list by category, or display across a map. For examples, see http://novopay.in/\n\nA helpful resource and guideline for the design is the slide deck from CGAP outlining the 21 principles of of design of smartphone interfaces for mobile money below.
