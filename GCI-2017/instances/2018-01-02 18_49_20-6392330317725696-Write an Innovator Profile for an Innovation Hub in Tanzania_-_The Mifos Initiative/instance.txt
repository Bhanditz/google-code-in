Title: Write an Innovator Profile for an Innovation Hub in Tanzania
Description: Part of the Mifos Initiative strategy in 2017 and 2018 as we bring to market an application framework for digital financial services is to evangelize the brand new cloud-native microservices architecture to fintech startups at tech hubs, accelerators, fintech labs, and innovation challenges worldwide.

The message is to build apps not infrastructure and they should build on top of our open source banking infrastructure so they can accelerate the time to market for their solution by focusing on building their app and the unique innovation needed by their customer.
