Description: See issue for screenshots and full detail:

For quick reference, the color icons by client name denote the status of the client. For those who don't know what status the color corresponds to, the actual status should be displayed in a tooltip when hovering over, as is the case with the color squares by the loan and savings accounts.

Navigate to any client, when placing cursor over the colored circle by client name, Tooltip should display the status

Green - Active
Yellow - Pending
Black/Grey - Closed
Red - Transfer in Progress
