Title: Research the hourly rates of UX Designers by country
Description: As part of the documentation of the social impact of our initiative, we want to assign a dollar value to the contributions we receive from our volunteers. These volunteers come from a range of fields, experience levels, and locations. For this task, we're gathering data on UI and UX designers. 

So we need to gather data points on UI/UX Designers by country/location, by level of experience, web, etc. 

You can use websites like glassdoor, payscale, salary explorer to do the research. You should document your findings in a Google Sheet and any other corresponding materials. Google Sheet should include profession, location, experience level, development language or stack, hourly rate, and another details.

Research shoudl at least include information for United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Latin America, Germany, UAE, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, India, Philippines, Netherlands, South Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe SE Asia, Myanmar, and Uganda
