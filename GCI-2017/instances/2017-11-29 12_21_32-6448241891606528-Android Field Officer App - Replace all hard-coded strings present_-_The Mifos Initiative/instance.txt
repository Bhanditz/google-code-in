Title: Android Field Officer App - Replace all hard-coded strings present
Description: **Android Field Officer App** currently contains a lot of hard-coded strings in the code; having hard-coded strings in the code is not desirable as it makes the app difficult to translate into different languages. 

Your task would be to replace all hard-coded strings present in code with **@string resource** annotation. All the hard-coded strings need to be removed from the code and then placed in the **strings.xml** resource file. The removed hard-coded strings then need to be referenced from the **strings.xml** resource file in the code.

**NOTE -** Some hard-coded strings need **not** be replaced in the android layout resource file, as they'll be rendered in real time when the app runs.
