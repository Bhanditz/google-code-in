These volunteers come from a range of fields, experience levels, and locations. For this task, we're gathering data on software engineers. \n\nSo we need to gather data points on software engineers by country/location, by level of experience, by skillset - full-stack, mobile, web, etc. \n\nYou can use websites like glassdoor, payscale, salary explorer to do the research. You should document your findings in a Google Sheet and any other corresponding materials. Google Sheet should include profession, location, experience level, development language or stack, hourly rate, and another details.\n\nResearch shoudl at least include information for United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Latin America, Germany, UAE, Kenya, Nigeria, Ghana, India, Philippines, Netherlands, South Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe SE Asia, Myanmar, and Uganda",
