These volunteers come from a range of fields, experience levels, and locations. For this task, we're gathering data on UI and UX designers. \n\nSo we need to gather data points on UI/UX Designers by country/location, by level of experience, web, etc. \n\nYou can use websites like glassdoor, payscale, salary explorer to do the research.
