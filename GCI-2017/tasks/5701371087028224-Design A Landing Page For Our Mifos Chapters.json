    "description": "We have recently launched a network of local Mifos Chapters. We would like to do a high-fidelity design of the landing page to navigate to the respective local chapters. This design should incorporate a global map and the ability to click to the respective chapter website based on the city where they\u2019re located. Here is an example chapter website: http://nairobi.mifos.org/. This should be capable of being implemented in Wordpress.  See http://plusacumen.org/ and the Global Chapter Network map for a design we\u2019d be interested in emulating. Submit your .ai files here ( https://goo.gl/9H1Yga )",
