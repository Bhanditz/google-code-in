We have to redesign the center details and make sure we can CardView on this details page to make it better.\n\nJust make a mockup and send PR through the Github link, we will review and we will make change accordingly.\n\nIf you need access to a Balsamiq account to make mockup, let us know. You can use sketch, pencil/paper - whatever you'd like.",
