    "description": "**Android Field Officer App** currently contains a lot of hard-coded strings in the code; having hard-coded strings in the code is not desirable as it makes the app difficult to translate into different languages. \n\nYour task would be to replace all hard-coded strings present in code with **@string resource** annotation. All the hard-coded strings need to be removed from the code and then placed in the **strings.xml** resource file. The removed hard-coded strings then need to be referenced from the **strings.xml** resource file in the code.\n\n**NOTE -** Some hard-coded strings need **not** be replaced in the android layout resource file, as they'll be rendered in real time when the app runs.\n\n**References - **\n\n1-> [GitHub issue](https://github.com/openMF/android-client/issues/412 \"Hard-coded strings\")\n\n2-> [Documentation on String Resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html \"Documentation\")\n \n3-> [How to find hard-coded strings in an Android app](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30799211/android-find-all-hardcoded-strings-in-code-using-android-studio \"Hint\")",
